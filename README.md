# Trading Games on Iron Ore Markets

This repository contains the implementation of two trading games applied exclusively to the **iron ore market**, as part of an academic coursework project.

## Project Overview
The objective is to study and compare quantitative trading strategies on iron ore assets using two distinct frameworks:
- **Trading Game 1**: Optimal market-neutral trading strategies.
- **Trading Game 2**: Active trading strategies aiming to outperform passive benchmarks.

Both games rely on the same cleaned and unified iron ore dataset to ensure consistency and comparability.

## Contents
- Replicable Python notebooks for each trading game.
- A single dataset including all iron ore assets used in the analysis.
- A PDF report covering commodity sector analysis, data preparation, methodologies, and results.

## Data
All analyses are conducted on iron ore-related assets. Data sourcing, cleaning procedures, and preprocessing steps are detailed in the accompanying report.

## Reproducibility
The notebooks are designed to run without errors in Google Colab, with explicit instructions for uploading the dataset before execution.

## Academic Context
This project was developed for a commodity trading course and follows the guidelines provided by the instructor.
